# gt

With the [gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/index.html) package, anyone can make wonderful-looking tables using the R programming language. 

The gt philosophy: we can construct a wide variety of useful tables with a cohesive set of table parts. These include:
- the table header
- the stub
- the column labels and spanner column labels
- the table body
- the table footer

The goal of [gtExtras](https://jthomasmock.github.io/gtExtras/) is to provide some additional helper functions to assist in creating beautiful tables with gt.

The [gtsummary](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/) package provides an elegant and flexible way to create publication-ready analytical and summary tables using the R programming language.

The [pointblank](https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/) package makes it easy to validate your data whether in the form of data frames or as database tables.
